class DecoderLayer(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Implements a single layer of the Transformer Decoder.

    A decoder layer consists of three main sub-layers:
    1.  A masked multi-head self-attention mechanism. This ensures that predictions
        for a position can only depend on known outputs at positions less than the
        current position.
    2.  A multi-head attention mechanism over the output of the encoder stack. This
        is where the decoder "attends" to the input sequence.
    3.  A position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

    Each of these sub-layers has a residual connection around it, followed by
    layer normalization.
